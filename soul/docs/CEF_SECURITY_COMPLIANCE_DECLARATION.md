### DECLARATION OF COMPLIANCE WITH EU SECURITY REQUIREMENT & CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SOVEREIGNTY

I, the undersigned, acting as the Sovereign Systems Architect and authorized legal representative of **AETERNA**, hereby declare and certify the following security compliance metrics regarding the deployment and operation of the **AETERNA-SCW (AIGIS Subsea Shield)** system:

#### 1. Zero Cloud Dependency & Data Sovereignty
The AETERNA-SCW control plane operates under a strict **Zero-Entropy, On-Premise Execution** paradigm. There is no transmission of telemetry, packet headers, metadata, or phase shift statistics to third-party or non-EU cloud service providers. All Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) and State of Polarization (SOP) monitoring data is processed locally at submarine cable landing-station edge nodes within the sovereign territory of the European Union.

#### 2. Clean-Room Software Stack & Zero Untrusted Third-Country Technology
All core mathematical layers, including the real-time subsea signal classifiers, are built using a native, vectorized codebase (compiled via the **Mojo** system with integer-only math). We guarantee that:
* No software libraries or hardware components in the hot execution path originate from jurisdictions outside of the European Union or NATO member states.
* No closed-source, proprietary components from third countries are utilized, bypassing logical backdoors.
* The system is compliant with the **EU 5G Toolbox** and critical telecommunications infrastructure supply-chain guidelines.

#### 3. Active Cyber-Physical Defense & eBPF Process Isolation
Landing-station SCADA terminals are hardened using kernel-level **eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) Sentinel** containment modules. In the event of physical fiber tampering or line tapping, AIGIS triggers instant process apoptosis and trunk traffic isolation in **under 1.02ms**, preventing data extraction without relying on traditional network routing layers which are vulnerable to lateral exploits.

#### 4. Compliance with EU Regulatory Frameworks
The proposed system architectures and organizational controls of AETERNA are fully compliant with:
* The **NIS2 Directive** (Directive EU 2022/2555) on cyber security risk-management measures.
* The **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**, as all patient, consumer, and transit telecommunication data is completely isolated and never stored or inspected.
* The **EU AI Act**, certifying that our real-time Mojo classifiers operate as deterministic mathematical signal separators and do not engage in biometric tracking or high-risk profiling.
