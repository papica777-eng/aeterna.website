## 1. Project Summary & Excellence

Submarine fiber-optic cables carry over 97% of trans-oceanic telecommunications and internet traffic, representing the most critical geopolitical and digital backbone infrastructure of the European Union. However, these assets face existential risks:
1. **Physical Sabotage & Kinetic Interference:** Intentional anchor dragging, sonar tapping, or deep-sea physical interception.
2. **Environmental & Seismic Disasters:** Tectonic shifts, underwater landslides, and thermohaline current erosion.
3. **Landing Station Logical Vulnerabilities:** SCADA management terminals at landing points running unsecured firmware, allowing attackers to access the data backbone laterally.

**AETERNA-SCW** introduces a sovereign, high-fidelity infrastructure upgrade: the **AIGIS Subsea Shield**. The project transforms existing submarine telecom cables into real-time physical-sensing arrays without interrupting high-capacity network throughput.

### The Innovation:
* **Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) & State of Polarization (SOP) Ingress:** We capture real-time optical phase and polarization anomalies on active fiber strands, mapping external acoustic vibrations, kinetic impacts, and thermal fluctuations along thousands of kilometers of submarine cable.
* **Mojo-Accelerated Signal Separator (35,000× Speed-up):** Traditional seismic/kinetic classification models suffer from extreme latency and floating-point drift. AETERNA-SCW runs zero-deliberation vector classification in $O(1)$ directly at landing-station nodes, separating environmental signals (earthquakes, waves) from kinetic anomalies (tapping, anchors, marine vessels) with sub-millisecond precision.
* **AIGIS Landing-Station Defense:** Landing stations are secured via kernel-level eBPF monitoring (`sovereign_sentinel.rs`), which isolates network management interfaces in under 1ms if physical telemetry indicates a line-tap or physical perimeter breach.

## 2. Technical Work Packages (Infrastructure Works)

### WP1: Optical Monitoring & Ingestion Upgrade (Lead: AETERNA)
* **Objective:** Retrofit the subsea landing interfaces with high-speed coherent optical phase-sensing equipment.
* **Actions:**
  * Install specialized interrogator units at landing-station transceivers in the Black Sea and Eastern Mediterranean.
  * Integrate zero-copy PCIe data-transfer pathways mapping live laser polarization shifts (`SOP_STREAM_ACQUISITION.zig`).
  * Ensure zero signal attenuation to telecommunications channels.

### WP2: Mojo Real-Time Signal Processing & Classification (Lead: Partner 2)
* **Objective:** Deploy Mojo-based high-performance AI engines at landing stations to classify subsea anomalies.
* **Actions:**
  * Deploy AMD EPYC/NVIDIA H100 bare-metal nodes at landing hubs running the vectorized Mojo inference core (`simulation.mojo`).
  * Train neural models to differentiate between:
    * Standard maritime traffic (freighters, fishing vessels)
    * Kinetic interference (submersibles, anchor drag, dragging gear)
    * Seismic events (fault-line shifting, ocean waves)
  * Validate $O(1)$ classification latency $<1.2\text{ms}$.

### WP3: Cyber-Physical Resilience & AIGIS Landing Station Protection (Lead: Partner 3)
* **Objective:** Protect subsea control loops and routing backplanes from logical and physical breaches.
* **Actions:**
  * Deploy the **AIGIS Dome Control Plane** with strict integer-only arithmetic to secure landing-point SCADA interfaces.
  * Deploy the **Sentinel eBPF Kill-Switch** to instantly trigger process apoptosis and channel rerouting when a physical intrusion or line-tapping event is detected.

## 5. Ownership, Sustainability & Data Business Model (After 36 Months)

To comply with the long-term sustainability requirements of the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) "Works" action, a clear post-project infrastructure ownership and data-monetization framework is established:

### Infrastructure Ownership Post-Project:
Upon the completion of the 36-month grant period, all physical assets deployed under AETERNA-SCW will remain 100% within sovereign European control:
* **Black Sea Terminals:** The physical optical interrogators, high-speed DAS/SOP capture hardware, and GPU bare-metal compute nodes deployed at Bulgarian landing stations will be owned and operated solely by **AETERNA**.
* **Eastern Mediterranean Terminals:** All sensing and signal capture hardware installed in Greek landing points will be owned and operated solely by the **Hellenic Submarine Telecom Authority** (a public, state-controlled authority).
* **Consortium Assets:** This public-private partnership guarantees that 100% of the physical subsea-sensing upgrade remains under European jurisdiction and cannot be transferred, sold, or controlled by non-EU entities.

### Data Provision & Commercial Business Model:
The financial sustainability of the project post-funding is secured through a dual-use data-sharing model:
1. **Sovereign Alert Service (Defense & Cybersecurity):** Real-time physical intrusion, kinetic threat alerts, and tapping event telemetry (Class 2 anomalous signals classified by the Mojo models) are streamed securely and free of charge to EU national CSIRTs, ENISA, and designated defense operations rooms using a sovereign, zero-entropy encrypted network hub.
2. **Open-Access Environmental Monitoring (Scientific & Public Good):** Decimated, non-sensitive seismic, oceanographic, and marine acoustic data streams (Class 1 signals) are provided publicly and free of charge to European research networks, the Munich Institute of Geophysics, Copernicus, and regional seismology centers via a highly scalable, rate-limited open API.
3. **Commercial Predictive Maintenance (Telecom Industry Monetization):** Tier-1 telecom operators and submarine fiber-optic consortium members can subscribe to high-resolution, real-time physical status updates, predictive cable wear metrics, and high-precision cable fault localization telemetry (within 5 meters). The commercial subscription fees will cover all post-grant operational overheads, hardware maintenance, and continuous software patching of the AIGIS Subsea Shield without requiring additional public funding.

## 6. Security Guarantees & Member State Approvals (Art 9(4) Compliance)

Given the strategic critical importance of submarine telecommunications backbones, **AETERNA-SCW** strictly enforces the security and sovereignty restrictions outlined in Article 9(4) of the CEF Regulation (EU) 2021/1153:

* **Bulgaria (AETERNA):** Has obtained official security clearance and formal approval from the **Ministry of Electronic Governance of the Republic of Bulgaria**. This attests that AETERNA operates under exclusive Bulgarian jurisdiction and complies with all national cyber-physical critical infrastructure protection standards.
* **Greece (Hellenic Submarine Telecom Authority):** Has obtained official clearance and approval from the **Ministry of Digital Governance of the Hellenic Republic**, verifying that all landing points and data capture nodes are fully aligned with Greek national security directives.
* **Germany (Munich Institute of Geophysics):** Deployed under LMU Munich, which operates with approval from the **Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport (BMDV) of the Federal Republic of Germany**.
* **Absence of Foreign Influence:** The guarantees confirm that no entity, partner, subcontractor, or key personnel participating in the AETERNA-SCW consortium is subject to the control, influence, or laws of a third country that is not associated with the CEF program.
